# Diabetc Retinopathy

DR is a complication of diabetes and a leading cause of blindness in the United States (U.S.). The retina is the membrane that covers the back of the eye. It is highly sensitive to light. It converts any light that hits the eye into signals that can be interpreted by the brain. This process produces visual images, and it is how sight functions in the human eye.

Diabetic retinopathy damages the blood vessels within the retinal tissue, causing them to leak fluid and distort vision.

There are two types of DR:

### Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR): 
This is the milder form of diabetic retinopathy and is usually symptomless.
### Proliferative diabetic retinopathy(PDR): 
PDR is the most advanced stage of diabetic retinopathy and refers to the formation of new, abnormal blood vessels in the retina.

The Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) has three different classes, namely:- 

1. Mild

2. Moderate

3. Severe

The presence of diabetic retinopathy in each image on a scale of 0 to 4, according to the following scale:

0. No DR
1. Mild
2. Moderate
3. Severe
4. Proliferative DR

In this project I have used the Inception Architecture. Refer to the following link on more information for Inception Network https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-guide-to-the-versions-of-the-inception-network-7fc52b863202

There are different versions of Inception available, namely :-
* Inception V1
* Inception V2
* Inception V3
* Incpetion V4
* Inception ResNet V1
* Inception ResNet V2

In my project I have implemented two Inception Architectures :-
1. Inception V3
2. Inception ResNet V2

The "models" folder contains the python file for the implentation of both the architectures(Inception V3 & Inception ResNet V2).
