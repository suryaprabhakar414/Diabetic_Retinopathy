# Diabetc Retinopathy

DR is a complication of diabetes and a leading cause of blindness in the United States (U.S.). The retina is the membrane that covers the back of the eye. It is highly sensitive to light. It converts any light that hits the eye into signals that can be interpreted by the brain. This process produces visual images, and it is how sight functions in the human eye.

Diabetic retinopathy damages the blood vessels within the retinal tissue, causing them to leak fluid and distort vision.

There are two types of DR:

### Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR): 
This is the milder form of diabetic retinopathy and is usually symptomless.
### Proliferative diabetic retinopathy(PDR): 
PDR is the most advanced stage of diabetic retinopathy and refers to the formation of new, abnormal blood vessels in the retina
